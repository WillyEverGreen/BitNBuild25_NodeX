## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot view bids"
**Solution**: Run the database fix SQL above. The bids policy was missing.

**Possible causes:**
1. Insufficient wallet balance → Deposit funds first
2. Missing escrow policies → Run database fix
3. Missing columns → Run database fix

**Check console (F12) for exact error**

### Issue: "Cannot accept bid"
**Solution**: Run database fix. Bids update policy was missing.

### Issue: "Student name shows as 'Unknown User'"
