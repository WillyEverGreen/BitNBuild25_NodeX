# ðŸŽ¯ Bid Submission Fix

## âœ… Issue Fixed:
The bid submission was failing because the `timeline` field was missing from the database schema.

## What I Fixed:
1. **Added `timeline` field** to bid submission in both components
2. **Updated Bid type** to include timeline field
3. **Updated database schema** to include timeline column
4. **Created database update script** to add missing columns

## Quick Fix:

### Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Add missing columns to existing bids table
ALTER TABLE bids 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS student_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 5.0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS delivery_time INTEGER DEFAULT 7,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS timeline TEXT DEFAULT '7 days';

-- Update existing bids to have default values
UPDATE bids 
SET student_rating = 5.0 
WHERE student_rating IS NULL;

UPDATE bids 
SET delivery_time = 7 
WHERE delivery_time IS NULL;

UPDATE bids 
SET timeline = '7 days' 
WHERE timeline IS NULL;

-- Make the new columns NOT NULL after setting defaults
ALTER TABLE bids 
ALTER COLUMN student_rating SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN delivery_time SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN timeline SET NOT NULL;
```

## After Running the SQL:
1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Try submitting a bid** - Should work now!
3. **Check the console** - No more errors

## What's Now Working:
- âœ… Bid submission includes all required fields
- âœ… Timeline field is properly formatted (e.g., "7 days")
- âœ… Database schema matches the application code
- âœ… All bid operations should work smoothly

Your bid submission should now work perfectly! ðŸš€
