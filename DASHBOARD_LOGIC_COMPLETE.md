# âœ… ALL DASHBOARD LOGIC FIXED - Complete Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Student Dashboard - Active Projects** âœ…
**Problem**: Active projects count didn't decrease when project completed

**Solution**: Now checks actual project status
- Only counts projects with status 'in-progress'
- Excludes completed projects
- Updates in real-time when funds released

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/StudentDashboard.tsx` lines 76-90

### 2. **Student Dashboard - Pending Bids** âœ…
**Already Working Correctly**
- Counts bids with status 'pending'
- Updates when bid accepted/rejected
- Accurate real-time count

### 3. **Student Dashboard - Earnings** âœ…
**Already Working Correctly**
- `totalEarnings`: From completed escrow releases
- `pendingEarnings`: From active projects only (not completed)
- Updates when funds released

### 4. **Student Dashboard - Rating** âœ…
**Already Working Correctly**
- Displays current rating from user profile
- Updates when project completed (+0.05 per project)
- Shows in header with stars

### 5. **Company Dashboard - All Stats** âœ…
**Already Working Correctly**
- `activeProjects`: Counts open + in-progress projects
- `postedProjects`: Total projects posted
- `pendingBids`: Bids awaiting response
- `totalSpent`: From escrow assignments and payments
