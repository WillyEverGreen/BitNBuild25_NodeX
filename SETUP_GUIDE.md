## üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

### Critical: Run Database Fix First!

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step. Without this, the app won't work properly.**

2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy entire contents of `FINAL_DATABASE_FIX.sql`
4. Paste and click **"Run"**
5. Wait for "‚úÖ Database setup complete!"

This SQL file fixes:
- ‚úÖ All RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ‚úÖ Missing database columns
- ‚úÖ UUID type casting issues
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket and policies
- ‚úÖ All permission issues

### What Gets Fixed:
- User profile policies (signup, view, update)
- Project policies (create, view, update)
- Bid policies (create, view, update)
- Escrow policies (create, view, update)
- Wallet policies (create, view, update)
- Transaction policies (view, create)
- Message policies (view, create, update)
- Conversation policies (view, create, update)
- Notification policies (view, create, update)
- Storage policies (upload, view files)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Failed" Alerts But Operations Succeed
**Symptom**: You click "Release Funds" or "Send Message", get a "failed" alert, but when you check the dashboard, it actually worked.

2. Code already updated to handle this gracefully
3. Now shows success if main operation worked

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Issue 2: Student Names Show as "Unknown User"

**Fix**: Already included in `FINAL_DATABASE_FIX.sql`

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
