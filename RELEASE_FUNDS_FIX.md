## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Release Fails:

**Check the error message in the alert** - it will tell you exactly what's wrong:

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Insufficient escrow balance"**
   - Solution: Assign more funds to escrow first

2. **"Student wallet not found"**
   - Solution: Student needs to login once to create wallet

3. **"Could not find the 'assigned_at' column"**
   - Solution: Run QUICK_FIX.sql in Supabase Dashboard

4. **"Failed to update user"**
   - Solution: Check RLS policies - run QUICK_FIX.sql

5. **"Failed to create message"**
   - Solution: Check messages table has file columns - run QUICK_FIX.sql

### Debug Steps:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Try releasing funds**
3. **Look for console logs**:
   - "Starting fund release: {...}" - Shows parameters
   - "Funds released successfully" - First step worked
   - "Student stats updated: ..." - Stats updated
   - Any errors will show here
